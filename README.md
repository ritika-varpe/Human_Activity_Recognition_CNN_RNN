# Human_Activity_Recognition_CNN


📚 Project Description:
In the digital age, the explosion of video data opens new possibilities for applications like Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Traditionally, HAR methods depended on manually engineered features and classifiers. With the rise of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), this field has transformed.
This project investigates the fusion of CNNs and RNNs for HAR, covering theoretical foundations, data preprocessing, model architecture, training and evaluation methods, case studies, and future directions.

🌟 Key Aspects of the Project:
-CNNs for Spatial Features: Extract spatial features from video frames.
-RNNs for Temporal Dependencies: Capture temporal relationships between frames.
-Data Preprocessing: Handle video data, extract frames, and prepare sequences.
-Model Architecture: Integrate CNN and RNN layers for HAR.
-Training and Evaluation: Techniques and metrics for assessing model performance.

🔍 Methodology:
-Data Collection and Preprocessing: Handle video data, extract frames, and create sequences for model input.
-CNN Architecture: Extract spatial features from each video frame.
-RNN Architecture: Capture temporal dependencies between frames to recognize activities.

📊 Model Training and Evaluation:
-Training: Use labeled video data to train the CNN-RNN model.
-Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy and F1-score to assess performance.

📈 Results and Discussion:
-Performance: High accuracy in recognizing and categorizing human activities.
-Strengths: Effective feature extraction and temporal dependency capture.
-Challenges: Computational complexity and large data requirements.

🚀 Future Work:
